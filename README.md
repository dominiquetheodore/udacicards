# udacicards

This is my submission for the flashcards project in Udacity React Nanodegree. It is a flashcard app letting the user create decks on any subject and add cards. The user can then take a quiz on a deck. The app sends a local notification to the user if he has not taken any quiz during the day.

# Installation
  - git clone https://github.com/dominiquetheodore/udacicards
  - cd udacicards
  - yarn
  - yarn start


### Testing

The app was only tested on Android.
